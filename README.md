# TeamSpark⚡
This full stack web application uses a remote server and database to manage a list of burgers submitted by users. The users can interact with the front end to create new items in the database and update existing items.

## Motivation
With workplaces changing rapidly and more people working from home or remotely than ever before, organisations need a way to easily access everyone's contact details to make day to day communication easier. TeamSpark⚡ aims to facilitate this with a central company directory that everyone in the organisation can access.

## Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/)
- [Adobe XD (prototyping)](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/xd.html)

## Features
Display the team list on a table with the main fields always visible, view each person's full details, search employees by first name, last name or city, filter the table by state and sort by either first or last name.
